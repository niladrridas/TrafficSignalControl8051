# Traffic Signal Control

## Overview

The Traffic Signal Control project utilizes assembly code for the 8051 microcontroller to simulate a traffic signal system. The code defines sequences for different signal states, including Green, Yellow, and Red, with corresponding delays to regulate traffic flow. This project serves as an educational tool, showcasing microcontroller programming for traffic management. Users can simulate the behavior of a traffic signal system by programming an 8051 microcontroller and connecting LEDs to represent the various signal states.

## Key Features

- Implementation of traffic signal control using 8051 assembly code.
- Simulated sequences for Green, Yellow, and Red signal states.
