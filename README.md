# Traffic Signal Control (8051 Microcontroller)

This repository contains assembly code for controlling a multi-signal traffic light system using an 8051 microcontroller. The code defines signal states, including Green, Yellow, and Red, with corresponding delays to regulate traffic flow.

## Code Structure

- **src/:**
  - This directory contains the source code for the traffic signal control, specifically the `traffic_signal_control.asm` file.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- 8051 microcontroller development environment (e.g., Keil uVision)
- Hardware setup for 8051 microcontroller programming
- LED lights for simulating traffic signals
- Connecting wires

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niladrigithub/TrafficSignalControl8051.git
